# Gitlab Util

The project was an initiative to make an automation on gitlab & zoho projects to automate project creation/updation using existing MRs. But i got some idea to make it a dashboard along the way

## Setup

1. Rename `config_copy.json` → `config.json`
2. Fill in the blank details

## Usage

```bash
python main.py [command] [options]
```

Not sure what commands? And there'll be a main.py soon.

## Install

```bash
git clone <repo_url> # No upstream as of now
cd gitlab-util
# pip3 install the dependencies
```

## Features

- Auto-fetch MRs
- Categorize by state
- Cool Dashboard
- More to come — maybe
